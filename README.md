# STACKOVERFLOW-LITE
StackOverflow-Lite is an app that allows a user to post questions, answer other questions posted on the forum. Users can accept answers to their questions and view various statistics involved such as the number of questions asked or answered.
This project is however just the front-end bit. The project UI is designed using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
